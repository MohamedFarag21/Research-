# Unet Training Script

This script is used to train a Unet model for image segmentation tasks. The Unet model is a type of convolutional neural network that is widely used for biomedical image segmentation.
Libraries and Modules

The script uses several libraries and modules including:

- torch and torchvision for deep learning tasks.
- PIL for image processing.
- pandas for data manipulation.
- os for interacting with the operating system.
- tifffile and cv2 for reading and writing TIFF files.
- tqdm for progress bars.
- numpy for numerical operations.

## Data Settings

The script reads a CSV file that contains the names of the image files. The images and their corresponding target segmentation maps are stored in separate folders. The script splits the dataset into a training set and a testing set based on a specified ratio.

## Model Settings

The script initializes a Unet model with a specified number of input channels and output classes. The number of channels for each layer in the Unet model is specified in a list. The model can optionally load weights from a specified path.
Training Settings

The script sets up the model for training by moving it to a specified device (CPU or GPU), initializing the Adam optimizer with a specified learning rate, and setting up the cross-entropy loss function.

## Training Loop

The script trains the model for a specified number of epochs. During each epoch, the script iterates over each batch in the DataLoader, performs a forward pass to compute the outputs of the model, computes the loss between the outputs and the targets, performs a backward pass to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters, and updates the model's parameters. The script can optionally save the model weights after each epoch.

## Usage

To use this script, you need to specify the paths to the CSV file and the image folders, the ratio for splitting the dataset, the batch size, the number of input channels and output classes for the Unet model, the list of channels for each layer in the Unet model, the learning rate, the number of epochs, and whether to save the model weights after each epoch. Then, you can run the script to train the Unet model.
